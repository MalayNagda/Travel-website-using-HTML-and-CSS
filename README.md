# Travel website using HTML and CSS
Being interested and travelling and being drawn to historic and culture defining metropolises around the world, I decided to make a travel website to implemenet
all the HTML, CSS and JavaScript concepts like images, lists, tables, forms, etc discovered through the instructor of the course. 

The objective was to implement a static website with all the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript being used along with a unique feature implemented by oneself. For this, I implemented the hover effect where the 
opacity of the image changes when one hovers over the images of the city that can be accesed by clicking on any city name in the 'Destinations' tab of the website. 

The entire project can be explored using the 'MainFile.html' document. The images were taken from Lonely Planet website and using Google Images.

Some pictures of the website can be seen below-
